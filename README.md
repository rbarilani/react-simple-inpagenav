# SimpleInpagenav

Simple "inpage navigation" React component.

## Demo & Examples

Live demo: [zalando.github.io/react-simple-inpagenav](http://zalando.github.io/react-simple-inpagenav/)

To build the examples locally, run:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Then open [`localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000) in a browser.


## Install

The easiest way to use react-simple-inpagenav is to install it with NPM and include it in your own React build process (using [Browserify](http://browserify.org), [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/), etc).

You can also use the standalone build by including `dist/react-simple-inpagenav.js` in your page. 
If you use this, make sure you have already included global deps (React, jQuery, jQuery.scrollTo, lodash, ...), and it is available as a global variable.

Add this to the dependencies section of your ```package.json``` file and then run ```npm install```:

```
{
    "dependencies": {
        "react-simple-inpagenav": "git://github.com/zalando/react-simple-inpagenav.git"
    }
}
```


## Usage

```
var SimpleInpagenav = require('react-simple-inpagenav');

<SimpleInpagenav>
	<SimpleInpagenav.Bar>
		<SimpleInpagenav.BarItem target="foo">
			Foo
		</SimpleInpagenav.BarItem>

	</SimpleInpagenav.Bar>

			Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb.

And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb.

			The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

			You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

## Development (`src`, `lib` and the build process)

**NOTE:** The source code for the component is in `src`. A transpiled CommonJS version (generated with Babel) is available in `lib` for use with node.js, browserify and webpack. A UMD bundle is also built to `dist`, which can be included without the need for any build system.

To build, watch and serve the examples (which will also watch the component source), run `npm start`. If you just want to watch changes to `src` and rebuild `lib`, run `npm run watch` (this is useful if you are working with `npm link`).
